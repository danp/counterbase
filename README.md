# counterbase

counterbase is a mobility counter directory and data ingestion system.

Using a directory of counters, counterbase crawls their sources and gets their data into a sqlite database.

This cycling counter data collected by counterbase is used by the [BikeHfxStats](https://twitter.com/bikehfxstats) Twitter bot.

## Status

counterbase is still very much a work in progress, probably with some hard-coded Halifax-isms.

And a lot of things I'd like to clean up.
