# todo

- remove hardcoded tz handling
- more dynamic source register, eg not always halifax transit?
- better data reading
- bring in time range querying from bikehfx
- comb over bikehfx for other bits to bring in
- clean up func main / command handling stuff
- source discovery, eg dump counters for some ecocounter setup
- set up from scratch for another env, eg calgary
- crawling concurrency
- maybe better counter schedule / active support, eg weekday-only buses
- halifax transit discovery from gtfs data
- ability to mark bad data ranges, such as to exclude from records
- change schema to cut down on size
- store directory in database, sync to/from json
- ability to convey counter status, eg low battery
